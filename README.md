# Introduction to Programming Mindset

While you might not have written code before, you have some assets on your side:
a positive attitude, a community you can ask for help, and a history of solving
problems on your own. In this module we're going to give you some language and a
framework for the strategies that you should embrace before you start solving
problems in code.

We'll cover topics that include answers to these questions:

- What makes an effective programmer?
- What does a programmer's mindset look like?
- How does the Flatiron Programming Process help solve programming problems?
- What's the best way to ask questions and learn from feedback?
- What are some strategies for getting unstuck when working on a problem?
- What is pseudocoding and how does it help us code?
- What are the community standards and expectations for asking questions and posting issues?

As you begin this journey, remember that knowing code is only part of
programming. The rest is knowing how to learn, how to ask questions, how to find
resources and how to solve problems. Programming isn't a mystical art that only
a few select wizards can master. It's a power that's accessible to everyone who
wants to learn. Over the next several lessons, we'll break down each step of the
process and give you the skills you need to become a programmer who can
accomplish whatever they set their mind to.
