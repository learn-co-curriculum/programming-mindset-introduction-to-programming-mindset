# Introduction to Programming Mindset

While you might not have written code before, you have some assets on your side:
right attitude, a community you can ask for help and a history of solving
problems on your own. In this module we're going to provide some language and
some names for the strategies that you should embrace before you start
"encoding" your solutions to problems in code.

We'll cover:

- What makes an effective programmer?
- What does a progammer's mindset look like?
- The Flatiron Programming Process
- How to learn from your questions
- Strategies for getting unstuck
- Pseudocoding
- Community standards for asking questions and posting issues

Points to make:

- Knowing the code is only part of programming—the rest is knowing how to learn,
how to ask questions, how to find resources and how to solve problems
- Programming isn't a mystical art that only a few select wizards can
master—we're going to break down each step of the approach and practice to
make it accessible and understandable
